            <div class="text">
                <p>I'm Nacho and I like to code cool stuff, I have done quite a bit of things with the library of pygame in python, for example I created my masterpiece of a game called 'steermaster' and I reproduced the 1 body problem in 2d. </p>
                <p>I'm currently learning web development, I have built simple things like recreating Googles's home page aswell as creating a image library</p>
                <p>I'm also interested in electronics and plan to start working with Arduino to combine hardware and software.</p>
                <p>In the future i will like to build real apps like a college guide map.</p>

                        <aside>Steermaster is a game where you drive a car throughout levels, each level teaching new skills and mechanics. I spent multiple months making this game in pygame, it has just under 3000 lines. There are 3 levels you can play, and there is a mode called speedrun where you can play them all in order and beat your times, you are able to select different cars, there is a leaderboard and you can ajust the difficulty </aside>

                            <aside> The Flooded Pathway is the first level of the game, it is very simple because it has the main objective of teaching you the basics: moving and steering. The map consist of a easy grass path with turns. If any of your wheels leave the ground, you will fall into the water with a splash. </aside>

                            <aside>Road of Chaos is the second level of the game, it indroduces the mechanic of moving people which you cannot hit. The map consist of a road in a deserted place with lots of pedrestians moving in a predictable pattern. I think it is very fun to because in some areas because the timings are very tight. </aside>

                            <aside>Icy Peaks is the third level of the game and by far the one I have put the most work on. In this level you slide in most of the map because of the floor made out of ice, which involves a completly new type of movement you need to master. There are also snowmen scatter around the map that throw you snowballs in somewhat of a random angle. If 3 balls hit your car, you are out, which is indicated by the live bar in the top-right of the screen. The map consist of an icy village situated in the peaks, there is a road with steps curves you need to travel. The hole map is decorated with houses, gardens, trees and even a freezed lake where people are ice skating. </aside>

If the time you just did is beter than any other time you did on that level, it will show a sign telling you.

Of course the time you did doesn't count as real. When you skip a level by this method it will say "Cheats activated" and when you go into the completion screen there will be banners on the screen turning on and off signaling that you are a cheater aswell of a pretty annoying looping audio that says: "You are a cheater!"
